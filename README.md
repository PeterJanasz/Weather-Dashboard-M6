# Weather-Dashboard-M6

## Coded By: Peter Janasz

## Description
Created a weeathe dashboard using vanilla JavaScript. When page is loaded, user is presented a search for where they can search for a city to get that cities current weather and 5-day forecast. The city searched is saved to a city search list, that the user can later click on to retrieve the corresponding cities weather info. The page is responsive so that all containers will display in a single column when viewed on a small screen.
